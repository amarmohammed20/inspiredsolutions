                    <p>
                        From obtaining my BSC Business Information Systems degree I have been in the IT industry for over 11 years, covering the basics from hardware all the way through to data warehousing. I have been part of many projects both small and large which involved a vast array of technologies. <br>
                        <br>
                        I have experience working with SME's from email deployment, CRM development through to website/web application builds. I have also worked for corporate organisations using oracle ERP solutions to achieve change management and data consolidation.<br>
                        <br>
                        In my most recent role as a consultant I acquired software language skills enabling me to completely customise managed CRM/ERP solutions such as <a href="https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/middleware/bi-foundation/fdmee-tuning-1112x-2349440.pdf" target="_blank">Oracle FDMEE</a> and <a href="https://www.oracle.com/middleware/technologies/data-relationship-management.html" target="_blank">Oracle DRM</a>, achieving the clients specific requirements. In the past I mainly focused on plain JavaScript but quickly started to see the benefits of other technologies/languages in both front-end development and languages such as JavaScript and Jython. <br>
                        <br>
                        Currently I am focusing on building on my front-end development profile whilst also working at achieving full stack status. My current arson of skills include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AJAX, Node JS, Express, Git, Git Hub and many more. Working on these skills everyday to build and develop websites/application on the world wide web. I also have experience with APIs, both pushing and pulling information in a secure and stable manner. Currently I am working on further developing my skills in TypeScript and Angular.

                <h4>Technical Support Engineer</h4>
                <p>
                    In this role I worked in a sister company of my previous employer Seismi to create a web application tool. This required me to build on my JavaScript knowledge through online academia and on the job training. This included software’s and software languages such as JavaScript and the DOM, Ajax, NodeJS, Express, Git and Git hub. In this role I also strengthened my HTML and CSS skills while starting to learn the Angular framework. <br>
                    <br>
                    I also gained experience with the Amazon AWS platform as test instances were ran on this platform before deployment. I was also responsible to support and integration so lots of work on API's.

                <h4>Consultant</h4>
                <p>
                    A consultant implementing complex Oracle ERP solutions for many large corporate clients. My role entailed implementing Oracle applications such as Oracle Data Relationship Management and Oracle Financial Data Quality Management. Oracle DRM was used to produce one standardized view for master data while ensuring validations were applied through  rules and properties. Oracle DRM was also used as the central hub for sending and receiving cleansed master data between many planning and reporting systems. Oracle DRM allowed me to use governance/workflows to direct change within a business to the relevant business people while ensuring validations were met, audit trails were automatically created and a standardised process was consistently followed. Using JavaScript code, I created and maintained sophisticated properties and validations, enriching the data for downstream and upstream systems. Overall I customised the standard Oracle product and tailoring the DRM package to exceed the client expectations. <br>
                    <br>
                    Oracle FDMEE was used as an ETL tool that would very neatly integrate into other Oracle tools such as HFM and Hyperion Planning. This ETL tool enabled me to extract data using data load rules with particular filters to ensure only the required data was extracted. Complex mappings (Explict, Like and Multi-Dimensional) were applied enabling the organisation to transform this data before any validations were ran within FDMEE. Finally loading this data into an Oracle Hyperion Planning application ready for the Planning & Reporting team. Through the setup and development of FDMEE event scripts were created using the coding language Jython. These Jython scripts enabled me to push the mapped data into the Oracle Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW).
